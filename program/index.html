<p>You can get all of these links at once by adding my <a href="http://sprng.me/iikek" target="_blank">Program Notebook</a> on Springpad.</p>

<p>Also - this site was built using <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> so obviously I would encourage you to check them out. Plus, building this site is how I learned Git.</p>

<h3>Bootcamps</h3>
<p>You might also consider one of these intense bootcamps, because when you want to learn something fast and hard, you go to Bootcamp. When you're done, your friends and family will think you're a damn genius, Gump!</p>
