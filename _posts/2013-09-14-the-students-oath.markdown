It consists of three simple promises:

+ I will not fear the unknown.
+ I will not consider any problem impossible to solve, nor any subject impossible to learn.
+ I will not give up before I try.

#### Why "The Student's Oath" ?

One of my very long-term goals is to start an alternative school. Colleges and Universities these days have “handbooks” — contracts students must sign, filled with rules and regulations. The students at my school will only have to take an oath, and this is it.

### Origins of the Oath
I’ll admit, I did learn quite a few things during my years of formal schooling. However, I estimate that I managed to avoid learning just as much, if not more. Ironically, I never took responsibility for my own education until I graduated from college.

I have been on a rigorous path of self-education for more than a year now, but it was only during the past three months, while working as an engineering intern for a tech startup in NYC, that I made significant breakthroughs in determining what kind of attitude and mindset is required of a life-long learner.

#### Why I Stopped Blogging

I first formulated the Student’s Oath as three rules while talking with a friend of mine about the reasons I had stopped the weekly blog posts I’d been writing about life as an intern at a startup on [Tumblr][].

I told her I’d stopped because I realized I’d been rephrasing the same three ideas week after week without realizing it. I’d been having the same epiphanies every week, but from different angles. Finally, the message actually got through for good, and I had nothing more to write about.

#### Thanks Boss

There’s a reason that I have learned more, and at a greater pace, during these past three months than I had previously thought possible. I have a great boss who understands that sometimes, the best way to teach someone to swim is to throw them in the water and let them figure it out the hard way.

You may notice that fear plays a large role in the Student’s Oath — probably because it was while I was flailing around and panicking that I learned the importance of not doing exactly that.

### The Big Idea

Really, the Student’s Oath could be summarized in two words, “Be Fearless.” That’s the big idea here, after all.

I have no interest in going back to my days writing and thinking like an armchair neuroscientist, so I’ll simply point out that there are a number of papers that point to some kind relationship between stress and learning. If you’re interested you can do a PubMed search for the effects of the steroid hormone cortisol on memory.

At the very least, fear and stress are distractions from work. They engage our attention without providing any tangible benefits. Day-to-day modern life isn’t often filled with obstacles that are truly worthy of panic or fear. By refusing to be afraid and by tackling every problem with a calm and pragmatic attitude, we can spend more time being proactive and waste less time worrying.

#### Usefulness of Emotional Responses

It’s become a habit of mine to evaluate emotional responses based on their value. Some, like excitement, love, joy, even anger, can help drive me to accomplish a given goal or task. These are useful, and so there’s no reason to seek to change or avoid them.

In other cases, emotions such as fear, anxiety, hatred, etc. are not helpful and can often be detrimental. These emotional responses are not useful, and I am constantly in the process of training myself to recognize and act upon them as early as possible.

It does not matter how these emotional responses make me feel. Love can hurt, hatred can be soothing. What matters is how they effect my constant struggle to better myself and help those around me.

### We are all Students

It’s becoming increasingly clear that education as a life-long pursuit is no longer an option. When I use the term student, I am not referring to people enrolled in formal educational system — just people. There are a number of reasons why education must continue outside of the classroom in the modern world.

#### The Pace of Progress

Technological advances are moving along rapidly. Upheaval and revolution are the new norm. Knowledge is dynamic, not static. There is no reason we should expect things to settle down any time soon.

#### Ever Expanding Pool of Information

Until we find that one unifying theory of everything, there will only ever be more to know tomorrow than there is to know today. You cannot possibly learn everything you need in school. You can go through all of the schooling required to earn a PhD and still have only just begun scratching the surface of all there is to know in your own highly specific field of interest.

The sad fact is, because of this truth, much of the time we spend in school is wasted because of the outdated notion that memorizing information is somehow related to knowledge or understanding. I could go on about this, but you should probably just read [this article][] from Brainpickings.org and the book that it refers to.

#### A Better World

A more productive, independent, confident, educated population can only make the world a better place than it is right now. That’s kind of what I’m trying to do.

### Once More

Three simple promises:

+ I will not fear the unknown.
+ I will not consider any problem impossible to solve, nor any subject impossible to learn. 
+ I will not give up before I try.
