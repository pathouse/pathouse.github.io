Yet another whirlwind week has passed. So much has happened. Let's get to it.

### This End Front
The first part of my week, which, if my feelings are correct, was about 2 millennia ago, involved a lot of front end work. So, just as I start to feel comfortable with **Ruby** and **Rails**, I'm thrown into a pile of something entirely different. A pattern is beginning to emerge...

**HTML**, **ERB**, and **CSS** were the least intimidating parts of the whole thing, and it was really cool writing **Sassy CSS** styles to match a web page to a design mockup. **JavaScript**, on the other hand, was a language that I had spent almost zero time working with in the real world. The same goes for **CoffeeScript**, even though its reason for existence is to make writing JavaScript more fun.

So I did what I have learned to do so well - try - and I eventually figured it out. Later in the week my boss gave me an awesome book - [**JavaScript: The Good Parts**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do "") - and reading it actually changed my perspective a great deal.

### Take it Back Now Yall
After that, I hit a problem that required me to write my first **SQL queries**. Having learned SQL, I must say how awesome it is that Rails writes queries for you the majority of the time, however, I found it to be strangely enjoyable. I picked it up very quickly and loved how fast it returned results compared to what I'd been doing before (dealing with entire Ruby objects tied to those database tables).

### A Stack Half Full Kind of Guy
So between dealing with the very front end stuff like JavaScript and CSS, and the very back end stuff like databases, I am beginning to understand the real value of being a **full stack developer**. There is a sense of power and confidence that comes with knowing you can deal with problems, no matter where they arise. As I settle into life as a programmer, it may be tempting to find a niche or a technology to focus on, but I don't think I ever will. Technologies are constantly changing, and the weakest points in the stack (in my experience) are the joints - where different technologies come together - and it takes a full stack engineer to deal with those.

### More Firsts
Oh yeah, and I wrote my first **Rake task** too. Woo! I'll have to remember to add that to my list of things that used to seem impossible and scary.

Another first - one that involved a bug that potentially took years off of my life - was my first contribution to **Open Source software**. I think I heard angels singing when that pull request was merged, though I may have been hallucinating after spending an entire day trying to fix what turned out to be one very small problem (and also the first instance I have encountered where I thought for half a second that static typing might be worth it).

### Am I a Real Boy?
Anyway, have you been reading this? Look at all this jargon… SQL? Queries? Static Typing? Front end? Full Stack?

*Am I a real programmer now?*

Sometimes I feel like my response should be *"Hell to the Yes,"* and other times it's more like *"Psh, build shit for 2 more years and then we'll talk."* And can I argue with the second voice? I mean, after all, consider what I thought I could build a month ago (nothing), consider what I am building today (stuff) and then consider what I could be building 2 years from now (exponentially more and better stuff).

I've decided to solve this conundrum by throwing out the question altogether. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter whether other people think I'm a programmer or not. You are what you do, and I "do" programming something like 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. Wam, bam, thank you ma'am.

### TL;DW
I see another pattern is beginning to emerge, and this one involves me getting to the end of a long blog post and being tired of writing yet having more to say… to the lightning round!

### LIGHTNING ROUND
* Startups are awesome. I don't think I'd enjoy working as much as I do at a larger company, and I certainly have no interest in finding out.
* Some things just take time - regardless of skill - like:
* Pattern recognition
* Thinking in code

* The best way to learn any language is still immersion.
