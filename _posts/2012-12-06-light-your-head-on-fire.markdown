## Once Again Please Mr. Yeats

I have used this quote already [once before][1] but I’m going to use it again because it’s just that good.

> “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”
> -- W.B. Yeats

While there are certainly many ways to literally set fire to your skull, this is generally considered an unhealthy practice and I would like to dissuade you from doing so, if possible. If you are dead-set on doing it anyway, I wish you the best of luck, but I warn you that you are unlikely to gain much in the way of education.

## What's All the Hubbub About School Learnin'?

Education – that’s what I’m really talking about here. The system we have going right now in the vast majority of public and private schools is hardly equipped to deal with the requirements of modern life, and I have my doubts about whether it was ever equipped for the task at any point in time.

Ken Robinson has does an excellent job of articulating this system’s flaws, both now and throughout history. He has spoken at TED on 3 separate occasions about these issues, so there’s not much I can add to the debate that he hasn’t already identified.

Instead, I’d like to focus on alternatives methods, such as __Montessori__, __Summerhill__, and __Waldorf__ schools. From these – which are all aimed at primary and secondary education – I’ll ultimately derive my own conception of a method of University education; an area sorely lacking in alternatives.

### Montessori

First, Montessori ([Website][5] / [Wikipedia][6]). Montessori education was developed by Dr. Maria Montessori and is based on the radical idea that, given the right environment, children will independently explore and learn in a way that suits their individual needs best. Naturally, this kind of free-form exploration of topics and ideas makes certain people quite uncomfortable. I’m thinking specifically of the sort of people held captive by the delusion that they know what is best, as well as [those who think respecting authority is important][7].

Famed British philosopher, mathematician, historian, social critic, and all-around bad ass Bertrand Russell, thought so little of the value of authority that he explicitly stated his contempt for it in his [Ten Commandments of Teaching][8]. Dr. Montessori was of a similar mind, and so the teachers in her educational methodology exist only to ensure that the environment is suitable for freedom of exploration and the development of independence in all areas of life.

Montessori divided up the educational process into 4 stages, each about 6 years in length. At each stage, she believed that the child developed to a greater or lesser degree in certain areas. For instance, in the first stage, lasting from birth to around 6 years, she believed children went through a period she termed the “absorbent mind” in which they picked up things from their environment effortlessly and without critical analysis.

What is most important about Montessori education is the fact that the focus is on questions rather than answers, the goal is the development of independence rather than proper behavior within a hierarchical administration-student-teacher relationship, and teachers act as mentors and guides during free-form exploration rather than judge, jury, and executioner.

In Montessori’s framework, the 4th stage of development, lasting from around age 18 to age 24, had no specific educational program, but she believed that economic independence was extremely important and saw no reason for an arbitrary limit on the number of years spent studying. I’ll address these ideas in my own program later, but first we still have two more methods to cover.

### Waldorf/Steiner 

The second methodology is Waldorf education ([Website][9] / [Wikipedia][10]), which is also known as Steiner education, and is one of the largest alternative methods in the world. Like Montessori, Waldorf education is centered around distinct periods in a child’s life, though unlike Montessori it distinguishes only 3 stages, each lasting approximately 7 years in length. Waldorf education places a special emphasis on the arts and spirituality in general, and views intellectual life as being interwoven with emotional, social, and physical aspects of development.

Both Montessori and Waldorf schools focus on qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment. It’s this lack of “objective” measurement that seems to be the main cause for contention between traditional and alternative approaches to education. Yet another point of difference present in both of these educational systems is a focus on both creative and analytical elements in all subjects, achieved through experiential learning – something generally lacking in traditional systems, which perceive some sort of chasm separating “arts” and “sciences,” and teach largely through abstraction.

If this has bored you so far, I’m sorry I’m not sorry. Not everything in life is candy and unicorns, and thank goodness, since even that would lose its appeal after about a day and a half.

### Summerhill

Finally, we arrive at our last, and perhaps most unique, educational methodology, the Summerhill School ([Website][11] / [Wikipedia][12]). _The_ Summerhill School, because there is only one. Founded in 1921 by the man, the myth, the legend, Alexander Sutherland Neill, this English boarding school is run to a large degree by the students who attend it, leading many of its opponents to run around like headless chickens screaming cries of “Anarchy!” while dreaming up Huxleyan nightmares of sexual perversion and all-out hedonism.

> “No one is wise enough or good enough to mould the character of any child. What is wrong with our sick,
> neurotic world is that we have been moulded, and an adult generation that has seen two great wars and
> seems about to launch a third should not be trusted to mould the character of a rat”
> 
> -- A.S. Neill

See where the dude is coming from? Can you blame him?

In any event, students at the school get to decide what they do with their day, what classes they attend (if any), and basically live the independent life of an adult from the get-go. Summerhill is the basis of the Democratic Schools movement and has inspired many others, including the [Brooklyn Free School][13] right here in the good ol’ US of A. These schools are much more concerned with allowing students the freedom to pursue their own interests and the ability to exist in a democratic society than with particular methods of teaching and learning.

And there you have it. A brief summary of 3 alternative education methods that sharply contrast the system currently in place. In each case, these schools are concerned with primary and secondary education, but I am concerned with tertiary education.

## The Democratic University of Awesome

The level of freedom enjoyed by students at colleges and universities is certainly far greater than that enjoyed by primary and secondary students, but it remains quite stunted in comparison to “real life.” In [an interview with Reason Magazine editor Nick Gillespie][14], Alan Charles Kors, a professor of European History at the University of Pennsylvania, laments the “infantilization” of students and the return of [in loco parentis][15] – what Kors refers to as a “generational swindle of epic proportions”.

So, with that an the aforementioned alternatives in mind, I’d like to put forward a new model of what college education and the “college experience” could be like. It is very simple. I won’t bore you with details and lesson plans. You only need to know 2 basic principles under which such a school would operate, and that, if I am ever able to create it, it will be called the Democratic University of Awesome.

First, in the tradition of Summerhill and other democratic schools, there would be no purely administrative staff. Rather, the entire running of the school, everything from maintenance to the bookstore to the cafeteria, and beyond, would be student run. Teachers would act as mentors both inside and outside the classroom, offering assistance when needed.

This would solve several problems, perhaps most importantly the issue of bloated administrative bureaucracies that play a large role in the rising cost of education.

+ __Exhibit A__ – [The Wall Street Journal][16]
+ __Exhibit B__ – [Bloomberg][17]

How could an entire community survive if it is run entirely by students? Legally, every student at a college or university is an adult, and there is absolutely no reason they would be unable to act independently and responsibly. This myth of the value of the “college experience” is, in my opinion, nothing more than the excuse to act like a child for another 4 years. Binge drinking is not, and has never been, a necessary step in human development. However, if you treat someone like a child, they’re going to act like one.

The second and final principle is this – resumes, not transcripts. Like other alternative methods, I would do away with any attempts at quantitative assessment and allow the student’s work to speak for itself, rather than having a teacher speak for the student. If the goal of college education is to prepare students for the workplace, why do we send them out with a sheet full of nearly meaningless letter grades in classes whose names offer only the vaguest idea of what was actually studied, and almost no clue as to what work was actually done. Instead, everything the student does will be a project grounded in reality – English students will work on blogs, submit articles to magazines and newspapers; Computer Science students can will contribute to open source projects with their work evident on sites such as [GitHub][18] and [StackOverflow][19]; the list goes on and on. At the end of their college career (wherever they deem that to be) they’ll leave with a resume in hand that demonstrates real experience and real achievement.

That’s enough for one sitting. Think about it. Over an out.
