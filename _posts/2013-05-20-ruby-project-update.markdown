##A New Day... Almost

Technically, a full day hasn't passed since I published my first post about my task tracker Ruby project. Yet, some very exciting progress has been made. Allow me to elaborate. 

###What I have accomplished

Visually, everything looks the same, and I'm happy enough with it that I probably won't be making any changes to that anytime soon. Functionally, quite a bit has happened. 

1. I wrote a new module for checking in to existing tasks. 
2. I wrote a control panel module for executing various functions through the console without explicitly calling them using 'ruby blahblah.rb' as I had been doing before. 
3. I found an awesome Firefox extension called [Auto Reload][1] that automatically refreshes the browser when changes to the open file are detected. 

All of these updates work and I am well pleased. I also got the chance to work with a bunch of new things like... 

1. Branches and merging in Git
2. In Ruby I got my first taste of `case` statements, the `Time` class, and the `load` function. 

###What's Next?

My agenda looks like this:

1. Write module for creating new task files
2. Other things I think up along the way.

Boom. What a trip. It works well enough for now so I'm taking a break and going back to working on the actual tasks this thing was built to track in the first place.
