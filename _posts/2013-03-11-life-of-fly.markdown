## The Common Housefly

The common housefly or [Musca domestica][1], usually lives somewhere between 15 to 30 days. What a brief and small life, we may think to ourselves while contemplating our own lifespan, which a few rudimentary calculations suggest is something like 840 times longer.

Silly humans. It’s not your fault that your concept of time is shaped by the rate at which you perceive it.

## The TED Talk that Started it All

Let’s rewind and talk this thing through like adults. First, you’ll want to watch [this TED talk][2], in which Michael Dickinson explains all that is gnarly about our little insect friends. The bottom line – flies are fast. They are so fast, that studying them has had a substantial effect on Mr. Dickinson’s movements and speech patterns:

> "I used to study mice. When I studied mice I used to talk really slowly. And then something happened
> when I started to work on flies."

Who needs amphetamines when you have fly science? To visualize how flies alter their flight path, we need to film them with high-speed cameras that capture 7,000 frames per second. Which brings me to the part where I attempt to apply some hard numbers to this squishy concept of “time perception.”

## Flicker Fusion Threshold

Most films are shot at around 24 frames per second. What you’re actually watching is a slide show so fast you perceive it as a single moving image. The number of distinct “moments” you perceive each second is defined as your “flicker fusion threshold.” The flicker fusion threshold for humans is somewhere around 70 Hz. To put this in simple terms, if someone was to turn a light on and off 70 times per second, you’d perceive the light as always on. Flies, on the other hand, are thought to have a flicker fusion threshold closer to 300 Hz.

## Out on a Limb

This is the part where I may be completely wrong. Here’s what I get from all this flicker talk: we experience life at a rate of somewhere around 30 “moments” per second, while flies experience it about 100 times faster at closer to 300 “moments” per second. What feels like one second to each of us might feel more like 100 seconds (or just over a minute and a half) to a fly.

Despite having a brain of “only” about 100 thousand neurons (compared to our own, which weigh in around 100 billion) and a lifespan of “only” about a month, flies are far from “simple” and their lives are far from “short.”
