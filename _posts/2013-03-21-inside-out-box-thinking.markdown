## Difficult is Good

> “Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty.”
> 
> -- Theodore Roosevelt

Mr. Roosevelt was not impressed by simple solutions to obvious problems. While this quote certainly speaks to his manlier-than-men persona, it also says something about the nature of creativity. While it might seem counter-intuitive, there is quite a bit of anecdotal evidence, and even some early clinical research, suggesting that creativity is fostered, not by an empty canvas or endless possibilities, but by rules, constraints, and challenges to be overcome.

I’ve written already about [what a silly world “impossible” is][1], and [why “can” is better than “can’t”][2] and it would seem that the same ideas apply here. Creativity is not so much about creating something entirely new and original as it is about finding a way to accomplish a goal despite everything working against you.

## A Bowl of Proof Pudding

Think outside the box, think beyond the box – however you phrase it, good luck trying to do this without a box. You need some limitations to come up with creative solutions to them. Take [Phil Hansen][3], for instance. He was a painter specializing in [pointillism][4], a method that involves thousands of tiny dots, so you can imagine how he felt when he learned he had suffered permanent nerve damage and would have a serious tremor in his hand for the rest of his life.

What did his neurologist tell him to do? [“Embrace the shake.”][5] Here is your box – now find a way out.

## Wasn't the First, Won't be the Last

Hansen wasn’t the first painter to discover the power of limitations. [Piet Mondrian][6] is yet another example:

>"only working with strain lines, 90-degree angles, and primary colors… Piet helped to spur on a modernist
> approach to art and fuel the creation of Neo-Plasticism. His paintings are recognized around the world, even
> today."

## Redefining the Task at Hand

Quite often, these creative solutions redefine the very nature of what’s being done. Before [Austin Kleon][7] began making newspaper blackout poems, I doubt many people had considered the possibility that "writing" poetry could look more like sculpting – starting out with a chunk of text and chipping off the words that aren’t a part of the poem.

Artist [Nina Katchadourian][8] does work that is very similar, though with book spines rather than newspapers, and she doesn’t get to cross out words she doesn’t like.

Every medium you’ll ever work in has specific constraints, and a surprising amount of innovation can come about from something as seemingly simple as ["variations on a rectangle."][9] 

## Sonnets and I

I’ve had this intuition for some time, mostly because I have always found it incredibly easy to write sonnets. Ask to me write free verse and I might sit there with a blank stare on my face for hours, but I can whip up a sonnet in minutes flat. Iambic pentameter, 3 quatrains and a couplet. Boom.

The creativity in such an act isn’t about building something entirely new, it’s about filling this existing structure in a novel way. It’s about solving the "problem" that the rules pose.

Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer agrees and cites the same sort of examples in her article [Creativity Loves Constraints][10]...

> "But if you look deeper, you’ll find that some of the most inspiring art forms, such as haikus, sonatas, and
> religious paintings, are fraught with constraints. They are beautiful because creativity triumphed over the
> 'rules.' Constraints shape and focus problems and provide clear challenges to overcome."

## Constraints vs. Inhibition

Working within the rules may be important for creativity, but we need to make a distinction between outside limitations and personal inhibition. You might have to fight to overcome the challenges at hand, but you don’t need to overcome yourself. In fact, early fMRI research into [the changes that occur in the brain during improvisation][11] – particularly musical improv. – suggest that the region of the brain in charge of self-monitoring actually turns off. You can’t be creative and self-conscious at the same time.

But does this whole discussion about constraints and creativity apply to improvisation? This article from [Mashable][12] suggests it does:

> "Good improvisation also follows unspoken rules: You must accept all contributions, you must justify anything
> that's introduced on stage, and everyone must participate."

So, it would seem that there are different kinds of limits. Some, placed upon us by the problem at hand, can stir our creativity and lead us to come up with surprising solutions. Others, largely internal ones, can lead to second-guessing and a failure to act.

## Once Again, Balance is the Answer

What's needed is a balance. Not just any old constraint, but what research psychologist Teresa Amabile refers to as [“intelligent constraints.”][13]
 
> "An intelligent constraint informs creative action by outlining the 'sandbox' within which people can play
> and guides that action not just by pointing out what to pursue but perhaps more importantly what to ignore."

So the next time you're faced with a problem that lacks an obvious or straightforward solution, get pumped. You're on to something big.
