## Familiar Territory

I’m well aware that some of you might have read my previous post, [Impossible and Other Silly Words not Worth Saying][1], with a generous pinch of salt. Sure, I provided some evidence in the form of a flashy [TED talk][2] by a woman working for a powerful and mysterious organization, but I realize that may not have been enough to convince you that words like “failure” and “impossible” aren’t worth saying. After all, it’s pretty clear that an urban taxi service operated by domesticated animals is a terrible idea, destined to “fail.”

I’m not changing my mind on this issue just yet, but I can understand some skepticism. You can’t just throw out parts of the dictionary you don’t like, but I think it’s important to understand just how much words and their meaning play a role in our thought process. Do a little reading on [Linguistic Relativity][3] (also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis) if you’re interested, but for now I’m going to focus on evidence rather than get lost in some heady theoretical debate.

## The Information

I recently finished reading James Gleick’s book, [The Information: a History, a Theory, a Flood][4]. It’s essentially the history of “information” and our understanding of it, all the way from African tribal drums (perhaps the world’s first binary code) to telegrams, the digital revolution, and where we find ourselves today.

### Drawing the Connection

So, how does this relate to my previous post about failure? Well, the ancient Greeks knew that it took great deeds to be remembered in the history books, and we’ve either forgotten that or most of us don’t care much about how we’re remembered, because if we did there would be fewer of us lamenting what “can’t” be done and more of us out there doing the “impossible.” I put these words in quotes because every great thinker and inventor throughout history has been told “no” more than they’ve been told “yes.” 

To cite specific examples from Gleick’s book, both [Charles Babbage][5] and [Samuel Morse][6] were mocked and derided for their suggestions. Babbage for his “Analytical Engine,” which was in many ways a precursor of the modern computer, and Morse for electric telegraphs and the related code that bears his name.

We remember Babbage and Morse, who continued to work toward their goals despite widespread doubts and disbelief. We don’t remember all of the “esteemed” and “brilliant” men who told them their work was useless.

Clearly, if you’re as smart as you think you are, you’ll spend more time saying “can” and less time saying “can’t.”
