## Where did the Time Go?

There is a saying that goes, "time flies when you are having fun." Time flies when I am coding and debugging. Therefore, when I am coding and debugging I am having fun. Not the woohoo fun of a weekend bender, but a quiet, intense fun of the sort I have not experienced since I was a child playing with LEGOs.

## Agility - Not Just a Move for Pokemon

I am passionate about education in that I am passionate about changing it. When dealing with large, hulking institutions like the system we are currently facing, it has become apparent to me that the most effective way of enacting change is to work from the outside – to present an alternative which can prove itself on the field of battle. Programming is how I plan to work with others to make it happen.

## The Wild, Wild Information Highway

My ideas about education are very personal. By that I mean that I see education as a very personal thing. I agree with Salman Khan when he says that taking responsibility for education is education. I guess you could say I am a bit of an anarchist when it comes to education. The internet is anarchy, therefore, the internet is the best place, in my opinion, for education.

## Build Straight from the Brain

Programming, like writing, is an act of pure creation. You begin from nothing, and you end up with something. What you end up with is completely up to your imagination. There are no physical constraints in writing, and what few physical constraints there are in programming can be overcome with a healthy dose of creative thinking.

## Communication 

I love communication. When you write, you need to communicate your ideas, held in words, to others so that they can “understand” them – so that they can do mental calculations on them and arrive at a result. When you program, you need to communicate your ideas, held in code, so that the computer can understand them, do its calculations, and arrive at a result. In both cases, the trick lies in aligning your desired result with the result independently arrived at by who or what you are communicating with. This is a non-trivial task. It is hard, and there is no guarantee of success. I enjoy the challenge.
