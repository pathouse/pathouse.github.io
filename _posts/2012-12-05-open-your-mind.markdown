## Another Open-minded Post...

Usually, when someone starts talking about the need to be “open-minded” I have a strange urge to take their words literally and apply them right then and there. Almost no one who pushes this philosophy is taking the medicine they’re trying to prescribe.

To be fair, it’s a tricky subject, and far too easy to sound like a man in the midst of an acid trip while talking about it. There are plenty of people out there who have opened their mind to the point that they’ve lost their head. A careful balance is needed.

## Liquefy Your Brain

But what is it that we’re talking about here in the first place? What does it mean to be “open-minded?” Personally, I think the best way to describe it is with the term “liquid,” which, in the chemical sense, refers to a material in which the relationships between atoms are constantly shifting and changing.

There’s Bruce Lee’s take on it, which he most likely borrowed from a number of similar ideas found in the [Tao Te Ching][1] – an ancient Chinese philosophical text.

If you remain unconvinced by Eastern philosophy, here is the same idea in plain old ‘merican English.

> _The Proud Highway_, by Hunter S. Thompson

So there it is. An open mind is not one that lets everything in, it’s one that changes. It’s generally accepted that this becomes harder to do as one grows older. This notion is backed up by mountains of anecdotal evidence involving crotchety old people and their problems with young hooligans making a racket with their rock and roller music. All the more reason to get used to this now before you’re the one in the wheelchair that nobody wants to talk to.

### Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

In today’s day and age, the ability to change is increasingly important. Things move a lot faster now, thanks to the Internet, and it won’t be long (geologically speaking) before rigid systems of belief become a thing of the past – a luxury we can no longer afford.

Lean and relearn are familiar ideas, but unlearn? In the past, “unlearning” was a problem that only cropped up once in a while among generations, like [Gallileo's heliocentrism][2]. Breakthroughs like these are never a problem for the younger generations, but for those stuck with the idea of an earth-centered universe, it’s hell on wheels.

This is all well and good, but there’s one problem. Human nature and scientific endeavors seem to be focused on a mission of putting things in their place, of discerning some natural order in the universe or imposing one upon it. Open-mindedness isn’t something you can just do. It’s a skill that has to be cultivated with practice. But how?

Personally, I like John Keats’ definition of the kind of mindset you need to cultivate, one he termed “negative capability.”

> “Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts,
> without any irritable reaching after fact and reason”
> 
> -- John Keats

This is the mental space you need to become comfortable within. In my opinion, the best way to begin cultivating such a mindset is to look at the world around you from as many different angles, and through as many different lenses, as possible. Which leads me to the matter of eclectic vs. esoteric.

### Eclectic vs. Esoteric

The world is becoming more specialized, we’re told, and thus the best way to spend your time is to figure out one area you want to focus on and spend your time nowhere else but there. The kind of knowledge you’ll pick up by doing so might be called “esoteric,” which Merriam-Webster defines as:

> (a) designed for or understood by the specially initiated alone
> 
> (b) requiring or exhibiting knowledge that is restricted to a small group

It’s true that esoteric knowledge is important. Graduate schools and PhD programs are designed to prepare their students to become experts in their fields by spending a minimum of 6 years filling their heads with information and jargon that is rarely understood by anyone outside of that particular field.

However, I’d like to make the argument that esoteric knowledge alone won’t take you very far. In fact, I’d argue that creative solutions to problems are extremely unlikely to occur in the mind of a man who has focused purely on one area of study. This is where “eclectic” knowledge comes in, which Merriam-Webster defines as:

> (a) selecting what appears to be best in various doctrines, methods, or styles
> 
> (b) composed of elements drawn from various sources

### Now for the Evidence

Here we have [Exhibit A][3] in which the multitude of influences of critically acclaimed Australian musician, songwriter, author, screenwriter, composer, and film actor Nick Cave, are written down on a too-small piece of paper.

And Exhibit B, a 4-part documentary titled [“Everything is a Remix”][4] which may lead you to doubt how long it has been since someone has done something entirely original, and whether originality is indeed real, or just a word invented by hipsters for the sake of irony.

Playing the role of Exhibit C is a quote by W. I. B. Beveridge from his book, [The Art of Scientific Investigation][5] which reads:

> “Successful scientists have often been people with wide interests. Their originality may have derived
> from their diverse knowledge… Originality often consists in linking up ideas whose connection was not
> previously suspected.”

Finally, occupying the position of Exhibit D, is [an interview with Alan Charles Kors][6], professor of European History at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes the main reason for teaching the humanities in college is so that students may learn to think critically, analyze arguments from a number of different sources, and gain and understanding of different perspectives and thought processes.

## Man on Wire

It’s true that open-mindedness is important, but as I mentioned earlier, you don’t want to completely lose your head. Balance is needed. Now, at the end of all that, a word of caution from the late, great [Carl Sagan][7]...

> “It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most
> skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to
> new ideas… Some ideas are better than others. The machinery for distinguishing them is an essential
> tool in dealing with the world and especially in dealing with the future. And it is precisely the mix
> of these two modes of thought that is central to the success of science.”
