## Television These Days...

I don’t know what the kids are watching on television these days, but when I was a lad, things were different. Universal truths were carried down from one generation to the next by such venerable emissaries as the Power Rangers and the Transformers.

I’m talking about age-old lessons like the value of teamwork. Sure, Dora the Explorer has an army of bilingual animal friends and camping gear to help her get navigate wilderness, but that’s not real teamwork. That’s one little girl clever enough to convince everyone else to do her dirty work.

### A Whole Greater than the Sum of its Parts

Real teamwork happens when individuals work together to take down a challenge bigger than themselves. Remember all those times the Power Rangers had to join their Zords together to form Megazord. And need I remind you of the terrifying power of the Constructicons, who, as Wikipedia reminds us, “are particularly notable for their status as the very first combining sub-group of Transformers, able to merge their bodies and minds together to form the gigantic Devastator.”

The lesson here is one we’re all familiar with: wholes are greater than the sum of their parts.

### You are a HumanZord

Where, exactly, am I going with all of this? Well, this kind of thing doesn’t just happen in TV shows from the 90s. It’s been happening in your body since your dad’s SpermZord and your mom’s EggZord combined to form the ZygoteZord that eventually become a FetusZord, which, after the addition of countless more CellZords, became you – a full-blown HumanZord. You are the result of a massive, coordinated effort between more than 300 unique cell types. Some poor cell in your intestinal tract might have dreams of running a fish taco bar on the beaches of Cancun, but they’re in your intestines, dealing with your fecal matter. That’s teamwork.

## BacteriaZords

It doesn’t end there, either. If you watch [Bonnie Bassler's TED talk][2] about chemical communication between bacteria, you’ll learn that A) bacteria do indeed “talk” to one another, and B) bacteria cells in and on your body outnumber your own cells by a ridiculous amount. Sure, some of these bacteria are going to try and kill you and live off of the nutrients provided by your corpse, but the vast majority are working in your favor, and that’s pretty awesome.

## Endosymbiosis: A Love Story

So my fellow human-cell-and-bacteria conglomeration, has your mind been blown into its numerous constituent parts yet? Actually, don’t answer that just yet, because there is still more.

In truth we could take this all the way down to the point where you’re not even sure if you’re real, but one more level will suffice and we’ll finally arrive at the real meat of the issue at hand. As it turns out, cells are themselves comprised of individual parts called organelles. There are two organelles that are particularly interesting, and each provide the energy needed by animal and plant cells, in turn. They are mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Evolution works in mysterious ways. While it’s incredible to think that our lives are intertwined with a community of organisms that live on and inside of us, scientists have come to believe that the link between animal cells, plant cells, and bacteria goes back quite a ways and is even more complex.

The Endosymbiotic Theory suggests that those cellular power plants I mentioned earlier – mitochondria and chloroplasts – actually came about from bacteria capable of respiration and photosynthesis that were engulfed by larger cells and eventually become incorporated into the cytoplasm. Now, the theory is unclear on the nature of this joining. Most explanations assume that these bacteria were able to survive the process of endocytosis, meaning they were essentially eaten by the cell. However, I was reading a lecture from MIT’s Introduction to Biology course and the following description of the process caught my eye:

> “And the mitochondria, as one has learned, are the sources of energy production in the cell. And,
> therefore, we’ll touch on them very briefly… One now accepts the fact that mitochondria are the
> descendants of bacteria which insinuated themselves into the cytoplasms of larger cells, roughly 1.5
> billion years ago, and began to do a specialized job which increasingly became the job of energy
> production within cells.”

I could go off on a wild tangent using this as a perfect example as how important it is to be conscious of the words we use when we talk about things and the ways that words shape thought, but for now I’ll exercise some control. It’s enough to appreciate that these two descriptions of the same event are markedly different.

In the first, the bacteria are benign survivors. The whale eats Jonah and he can’t get out so he starts shovelling coal into the furnace. In the second, the bacteria are foreign invaders. They break into the cell smelling like booze, looking to make trouble, and before they know it the tables have been turned and they’re doing all of the heavy lifting. Regardless, the end result is the same.

Alone, these cells were doing a poor job of producing their own energy, and the bacteria were getting eaten left and right. Together, they have evolved to build every multi-celled life form on the planet. They manage to work together to build us. Imagine what we might be able to work together to build. Unfortunately, we can’t just copy their team building skills and try to absorb one another.
