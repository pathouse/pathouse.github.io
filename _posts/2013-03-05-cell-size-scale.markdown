I first became aware of this capital “a” Awesomesauce graphic while taking [MITx 7.00x Introduction to Biology: The Secret of Life][1] over on [edX][2]. 

Major props to the University of Utah for putting this together. I take back everything I’ve ever said about Utah. Great state, glad to have you. Go check it out, but not before you firmly strap your head to your shoulders.
