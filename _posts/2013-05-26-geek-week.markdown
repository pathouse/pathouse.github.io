Yesterday, I was occupied with familial obligations. Today, I am occupied by the fact that Codeschool is offering all of their classes for free this weekend. So, naturally, I will be panting mightily as I attempt to consume as much material as possible before the clock strikes midnight. I imagine this is how Cinderella must have felt, except only my fingers will be doing the dancing in this scenario.
