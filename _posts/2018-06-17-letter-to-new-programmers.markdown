I love programming, but I didn't get to where I am by a straightforward path.
Most of my early stories involve failure and frustration. 

So I think a lot about what I would tell myself. Get ready for a tongue twister.
It's hard to understand, what was hard to understand, once you've understood something for a while.

As the years have passed, I have noticed certain core underlying things which, once understood, have
made a lot of other ideas "click". I will try my best to explain them here.

## Broken by Default

The first time you try to do something, it might not work. When I say first time I am also including the next
~40 times. Even if what you are trying to do is as "simple" as installing a new programming language or building some program from source
or use a package manager on Linux/Ubuntu/etc.etc.etc. for the first time - things breaking or not working is normal and expected. Heck, these days if something
works for me on the first time I am actively suspicious and hunt for ways it might have silently failed in some way. One day when you are
old and crusty like me, you will be this way too.

## Prepare for Pedantry

You don't have to be a borderline-obsessive pedant to be good at programming,
but practicing it for a while will turn you into one if you're not already.
You will become pedantic (and hopefully also good at keeping a lid on it
when in the general public) because programming demands specificity. 

"On two occasions I have been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' 
I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."
- Charles Babbage

You will become a very detail oriented person because programming is all about the details.

## Layers of Abstraction & New Thing Fatigue

Abstractions are a word with a world.

Often times you will start out saying I want to do A. Then you learn to do A you have to do 
B and C. Doing B, you learn after some time trying to do it, is best done with the help of
D. D has a complex configuration and it's written in E. Etc. etc. until you are so far
from what you originally set out to do it's comical.

You need to know when to take a break. There's a limit to new stuff you can absorb at once,
particularly when each new thing is a subject to be studied in itself. 

A good tutorial should help prevent this from stopping you in your tracks.
Michael Hartl's Rails' Tutorial comes to mind.

This happens because we use a lot of abstractions. Abstractions are great but they come at a cost.
But what do I mean by abstractions? That brings me to my next topic.
