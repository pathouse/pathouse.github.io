Where do I even begin? I thought I was learning a lot while I was teaching myself, and I was, but, as I probably should have known, quantity alone is an almost meaningless way to measure the value of information.

### Breadth vs. Depth
Before this internship most of my studying was about **breadth**. I would cover vast amounts of introductory level information in a large number of subjects. So I *was* learning, but most of the challenge was in staying awake and keeping my focus. I was getting myself acquainted with subjects, their associated jargon, methodologies, what have you, but I wasn't doing any of the real work of applying them to anything.

The real work - the kind of learning that increases one's **depth** of knowledge in a given subject - is what I have been getting into recently, and it's a whole new ballgame. I think I slept all of Saturday.

### Remove Quitting from List of Options
I spent the first couple of days tackling bugs and getting acquainted with the codebase. Then, on like the third day, boom, first feature, git 'er done. For those of you unacquainted with this lingo let me boil it down. Feature means top-to-bottom code for a brand new function. In the world of web development, that means model, view, controller. To make it even simpler, it means a hell of a lot more code than anything I'd worked on during my extremely short tenure as an intern.

I'll be honest, I was very scared at first. I felt overwhelmed and had no idea where to start. When I finally did start, rather than doing my usual "dive in headfirst and break things" tactic, I took things very slow. Almost certainly slower than I needed to, but it helped me get over the fear and keep moving. I outlined requirements, wrote a bunch of logic-devoid files for the model, views, and controller (kind of like the code that would have been produced by a rails scaffold command) and opened up existing code with similar functionality in another window to give myself a reference point.

I think I would probably have convinced myself to give it up had I been alone. I probably would have stopped at one of the many roadblocks I hit and convinced myself that I needed to learn more and abandoned the project to read more tutorials and type in more lines of code already written for me by other people so I could feel like I was actually accomplishing something. But I didn't, because I wasn't doing this for myself, it was my job. Quitting and taking a break just weren't options, so I kept going.

Simply removing the option of quitting is one hell of a motivator, sort of like cocaine is a hell of a drug. It didn't fill me with that everything-is-awesome-hooray-for-the-universe-and-the-power-of-love type of energy and enthusiasm that a motivational speech might have, but rather a sort of frenetic tear-apart-and-rebuild-everything-until-it-works type of energy one might expect to derive from nasally-ingested amphetamines. For a while I was essentially the John McClane of computer programming; one man vs. many lines of code, filled with the kind of grim determination mixed with dark humor that makes you shout "yippee-ki-yay motherfucker."

### Important Acronyms
Along the way, I think I've finally come to appreciate the two most important acronyms in web development - **MVC** and **REST**. But I'm still not 100% confident in my understanding of them so I'll wait to write anything until I've had more experience.

### A Word on Macs
I've had the good fortune to be able to work on a Macbook Pro and I've got to say, I'm afraid of what it's doing to me. I was all gung-ho Ubuntu and open source but Macs are just **fun**. That, I have decided, is why they're so damn expensive and closed-source. You pay all of that money for the convenience of everything working with minimal fuss. You've got to factor "fun" and "ease of use" into the price, just like you have to factor in all the benefits of city living into the cost of a room in New York. Otherwise, both Macs and apartments would be laughably expensive and not worth consideration. As it stands, they are both quite desirable.

### Closing Statements
Wow this post is sort of long and I have other things to do, so I'm going to end this with some rapid-fire one-liners to get out everything I want to say before the week arrives and my spare time is gone with the wind.

* Rubber Ducky Debugging Works (but people are still better when they are available).
* Hotkeys Rock.
* Coworkers Rock (nothing like the mutual support and understanding shared between two or more people embroiled in technical challenges).
That about does it. Until next time.
