This year I decided to try out live streaming my work on [Advent of Code 2020](https://www.adventofcode.com/2020)

There's a lot of very cool AoC content out there, ranging from the kind of competitive programming that will get you
on to the leaderboard, to code golf, to 3d visualizations of elves on toboggans crashing into trees.

My goal isn't to be incredibly fast or incredibly breif or incredibly creative. I'm writing code as if I want to ship it to production
so I want it to be:
+ well factored
+ easy to understand
+ tested

Hopefully I achieve some of those things.

I'm solving problems in Ruby initially since that's my mother tongue,
but I like to go back and revisit old problems in languages that I am learning as well.
