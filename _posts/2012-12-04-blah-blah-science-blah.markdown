## You Need it

Have you or someone you know ever uttered the words “scientific mumbo jumbo,” “gobbledeegook,” or any other phrase expressing a similar sentiment?

I know you have, because I was once guilty of such thoughts as well. This needs to stop. In today’s day and age, this is equivalent to playing Monopoly without money because it’s just part of those “confusing ruley things” and you don’t have the time to “like read them and shit” in order to learn how they work.

Indeed, just as you can’t play Monopoly without learning the rules, you can’t play life without learning the science. Now, this is not entirely your fault. Science is a very long rule book and it isn’t always right, but it is a much closer approximation to “truth” than any other method at hand is able to provide.

### Part of Modern Life

Eric R. Kandel, Nobel Prize winning Neuroscientist, expresses this very idea in his book, [In Search of Memory][1], where he writes:

> “Science is no longer the exclusive domain of scientists. It has become an integral part of modern life
> and contemporary culture. Almost daily, the media report technical information that the general public
> cannot be expected to understand…”

And let’s not fool ourselves into thinking that the “media” understand it either. What we have, as a result, is a situation in which one group is explaining to another group things which neither understand. Does anyone else have any doubts that this will work?

Kandel goes on to say:

> “In the course of our lives, most of us will have to make important private and public decisions that
> involve a biological understanding of mind. Some of these decisions will arise in the attempt to
> understand variations in normal human behavior, while others will concern more serious mental and
> neurological disorders. 
> 
> It is essential, therefore, that everyone have access to the best available
> scientific information presented in clear, understandable form. I share the view now current in the
> scientific community that we have a responsibility to provide the public with such information.”

I agree. We should have access to such information. But there are a few problems.

## "Stop talk, talk, talking that blah, blah, blah"

On the one hand, you’ve got teachers from grade school all the way through college who have an incredibly flawed idea of what science is all about and how to teach it. They think it’s a collection of facts in a book. As a result, they don’t teach it well, kids get bored (I was one of them) and when you try and talk to them about anything remotely technical all they hear is “blah blah science blah.”

On the other hand, you have these incredibly intelligent people who haven’t the foggiest idea about how to communicate their intelligence to others. I’m not talking about the rain men out there who have a natural handicap in the area of social skills, I’m talking about anyone who has ever earned a Masters or a PhDizzle in Anything. All those years of schooling and the only thing you can produce of public value are technical research papers and scientific journal articles that require an equal education level to understand?

And then there’s the matter of money. Sure, you can get your hands on these scientific journals and high-quality textbooks, but you’ll have to spend a small fortune to do so. Would you like to spend months toiling away at the concepts of Organic Chemistry or would you rather skip the textbook and buy something else with that $200?

### It's Not Learning We Don't Like

I mean, we have to admit at some point that it isn’t really the learning or the information that we have bad feelings about. We have a nation filled with pop-culture and sport-statistic geniuses because the information needed is free and readily available. 

ESPN blasts information (with equal portions of nonsense, hype, and bluster) about sports, and anything that could possibly pass for sports-related, into the airwaves on a 24/7 loop. 

TMZ, which made something along the lines of $25 million back in 2008 (we can only hope their revenues are smaller today) pays teams of “researchers” to sniff out anything and everything they can find out about certain celebrities. In 2008, the [NYTimes wrote an article][2] claiming the site received “more than 10 million unique visitors every month.”

### A Moment of Silence for Sanity... Thank You

Now, my point is not how much time we spend caring about things like sports and celebrities. My point is the fact that all of the information surrounding these topics is not only free, but almost inescapable. What do you think would happen if we reversed this situation? Sure, you can find out all of the latest gossip about your favorite “stars,” but only through a series of technical journals which carry an annual subscription cost so high that [even Harvard can’t afford them anymore][3].

There aren’t any words for the emotions I’m experiencing right now. I just have to shove them way down deep and try to carry on.

So far, we have an uneducated media trying to explain scientific information to an uneducated populace (Bill Nye & Co. can only do so much), we have teachers who think science is a collection of facts found in textbooks, we have very educated people who have no idea how to talk to those less educated than themselves, and on top of everything, money is sitting there taking a huge, green dump that wealthy institutions like Harvard can’t even afford to clean up any more.

### Awesome Plan Guys, This is Sure to Work...

Now that my sarcasm gland has finished secreting that last sentence, here are some ideas about how we can fix all of this.

Formal education is a beast so hairy and with so many backs that I have neither the time, the space, nor the energy to begin delving into it right now. Instead, I’d like to argue that once we’ve fixed the perception and dissemination of scientific information in the public sphere, formal education will work itself out one way or another.

I think science needs a press corps. A new breed of scientist trained in the art of translating jargon into good old fashioned English. A group of people like Bill Nye, Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Stephen Hawking, and Michio Kaku who work, not only on their own research, but on spreading their knowledge to the masses. Perhaps even more importantly, they need to spread the passion they have for science. Imagine someone yelling about science like Stephen A. Smith yells about sports (albeit, much more coherently). The folks I mentioned before, and other organizations like TED, are certainly doing something to change this, but they’re not quite on Sports Center’s level yet.

In my opinion, the money problem will cease once there are enough people out there who care enough about spreading this information that they’ll rebel from the current system – the scientific equivalent of a band like Radiohead, who [let fans decide the price][4] for their album “In Rainbows.” There are always going to be people out there who try and squeeze as much money as possible out of everything and anything, but their power depends on everyone else playing along. Just remember, we have the Internet now, so there is always hope. The Internet is information anarchy, and as Texas Ranger Bobby once said, “I don’t know what it means but I love it!”
