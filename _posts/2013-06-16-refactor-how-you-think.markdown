That is an apt title for this post because it's exactly what I've been doing during the first day I spent actually looking at and writing code.

When I started this blog I had it in my head that I was going to come home after work each day and write an articulate post about all of the insights I'd gained and the things I'd learned. Reality had a good laugh about that one, and I've quickly come to realize that this is going to be a one-post-a-weekend blog at the most, and only if I'm very lucky.

### If there are Super Interns, I am not one... yet
The most important thing I have learned so far is that speed is not a goal. Correct function, readable syntax, passing tests; these are all goals. I wrote quite a few stupid lines of code in a deluded effort to understand everything right away.

It is true that there are many things in programming that you can only learn via repeated head-bashing. Beating your head faster does not make this process any quicker, and might actually slow it down. Deep breaths, goosfraba, follow the method calls, etc. etc. Aesop might come off as a bit preachy but when you're trying to wrap your head around an unfamiliar codebase (especially one wrought with rails-witchcraft) slow and steady actually does win the race.

### This is Good News
If I had come into this internship and sat down and learned the codebase in a day and started writing lines of code at a mile a minute and worked 4-hour days (with 2 hour naps) and had enough time to write 14 blog posts a week, that would be **bad news** for reasons I don't think I need to explain.

Instead, I'm working long hours, getting handed problems I understand very little of (from a code perspective), being told to "figure it out," then making mistakes and being told to fix them, and this is all **good news**.

You don't get this kind of experience outside of a startup, and you don't learn much when the problems you face are solved by others who then regurgitate those solutions to you like a little baby intern-bird.

*The more you learn the less you know.* If that's true, I must be learning a lot because I certainly feel like I know less that I thought I knew a few days ago (and that's a **good thing**).
