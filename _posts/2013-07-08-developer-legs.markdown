So, it's been a month. This is blog post number five. I think I've finally gotten whatever the developer's equivalent of "sea legs" are (developer legs?). The Fear is making fewer and fewer appearances, or maybe I'm just so used to it that I hardly notice anymore. Either way, I'm settling in and getting to work. But make no mistake, things are not getting easier (and that's a **good thing**). Now, let's get to it.

### Exploring the Stack
One thing I severely underestimated before I started working for Artsicle was the number of technologies used to run a web app. I recently found this awesome article by Adam Wiggins, co-founder of [Heroku](http://heroku.com), called [The Twelve-Factor App](http://www.12factor.net/) and in one simple, direct swoop it covers all of the things I've learned "the hard way" over the past few weeks. When I get around to writing one of those things-I-wish-I-had-known-before-I-started-working-on-software-as-a-service posts, that article is going to be at the top of the list. Maybe it's just my right-braininess but knowing how all of the pieces of the puzzle fit together helps a hell of a lot when you can only see one or two at a time.

### New Things
I learned about Resque workers and background jobs, more caching, polymorphic database associations (which are SO COOL), and yet more JavaScript/jQuery/CoffeeScript stuff.

I mentioned making some open source contributions in my last post but it wasn't until this week that my second pull request to Pivotal Labs' [Cacheable Flash](https://github.com/pivotal/cacheable-flash) gem was officially merged. While I'm certainly no grizzled veteran, I'm already feeling the delightful tingle of power at my fingertips. If I want to use a third party library and it doesn't do something I want it to, **I can add that feature**. Woah. That's freakin' sweet.

### API vs. Source Code
Speaking of open source, it was while working with [Ransack](https://github.com/ernie/ransack) that the value of reading the source code for 3rd party tools became clear to me. If you want to know how to use something, demos and API documentation are great. But if you want to know what the hell it's actually doing when you use it, nothing beats the source code.

### All of the Courses
I used to think that if I somehow managed to take **all of the programming courses** I'd become a better programmer. Oh sweet youthful naivete. Now I see people on the internet posting things like "I want to work my way through beginner to intermediate to advanced material before I look for a job/internship/start a project" and I just want to shake them screaming "YOU FOOLS! JUST DO IT!" Nothing replaces experience. No single course I ever took prepared me for the real world. And I learned much more, at a much faster rate, when I was thrown into the codebase, handed a problem, and told to figure it out. And besides, **you can't remember all the things**. What Alvin Toffler said about 21st century "literacy" applies double to programmers and developers.

### Finally, a Word About Social Media
Now that I work on **THE INTERNET** I've been using social media a lot more, and more purposefully. I think that's important. Having a purpose, that is. All of the best social media channels have a specific purpose and that's important to keep in mind. I'm using Tumblr wrong, technically, by writing all of these long posts, but I really like their tagging, following, and discovery features, and I really don't like Wordpress, even though it has all of those things too.

But here's my point. A lot of ish has been talked about Google+ because it's not as popular, but after having used it for a few days now, I can only see that lack of popularity as a good thing. Smaller, focused communities are better. It's all about that signal-to-noise ratio baby. I'm enjoying Twitter so much more since I took my list of people I follow from close to 300 down to 90.

I guess most of this should have been obvious. I mean it's **social** media, where peer-to-peer interactions are the whole value of the thing. I think I spent too much time as a copywriter trying to sell people on the whole "viral" angle. Going "viral" is the exception, not the rule, and the best parts of social media involve finding that small subset of the population you connect with over some shared interest.

### Yadda Yadda Yadda
Alright that's about enough from me for now. Just one last thing. The more I work in tech and get a feel for how things actually work, the less I enjoy reading tech journalists. Journalism in general really needs to figure a few things out, but it's especially clear in STEM subjects where it's painfully obvious that you only have the slightest idea of what you're talking about. Can we all just agree that faster is not better and go back to doing real research? After that maybe we can work on those headlines. Thanks.

### Blarg Rant Blarg
I feel like this post was a bit rantish and I'm sorry I'm not sorry. This week was weird and short because of the holiday. I think next week I'll dive deeper into something technical. Later gators.
