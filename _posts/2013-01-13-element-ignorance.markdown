The Element
-----------

[The Element][1], is an insightful book from one of the world’s leading thinkers on creativity and education. In it, Ken Robinson presents the idea that “the element” is the place where one is totally engaged in what they are doing. 

There’s a lot of discussion about things like “passion,” “creativity,” etc. and the role that education plays (or fails to play) in connecting people with these things. All of Robinson’s arguments are backed up by real-life examples, often historical figures, who have found their “element” – often via unconventional paths.

### Key Takeaway

Don’t ask “how intelligent are you?”

Ask “how are you intelligent?”

Ignorance
---------

Scientists spend their lives discovering facts, right? Wrong. Stuart Firestein’s book [Ignorance: How it Drives Science][2] explains that the best scientists do just the opposite – they spend their lives uncovering ignorance. 

In a world where all of the “facts” can be found with the click of a button, this book is a wonderful testament to just how little we really know, and the powerful role that ignorance plays in our lives. Scientists, as Firestein explains, “don’t stop at the facts; they begin there, right beyond the facts, where the facts run out.”

### Key Takeaway

Real progress is the generation of more specific ignorance, and real science involves looking for black cats in dark rooms (if there really is a cat in the room at all).

Bringing Them Together
----------------------

Both of these books do an incredible job of revealing many ideas that we take for granted (the idea that creativity is only for the arts, that work and play are necessarily two different things, that science involves the mechanical uncovering of absolute truths, etc.) even though it turns out that they are completely wrong.
