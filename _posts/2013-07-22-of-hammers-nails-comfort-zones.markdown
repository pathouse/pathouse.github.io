Blog post number 7. BAM, look at that bacon sizzle (unless you're a vegan, in which case, look at that tofu wobble and forget about the bacon). Anyway, big things poppin' this week. As always. And it was the first weekend that I was non-exhausted enough to do some extra-curricular coding so that's pretty freakin' sweet. But more on that laterâ€¦

### Things I Learned
You're in luck. I'm so tired I don't even have the energy for wild tangents. It's all about the bullet points, baby.

* **CoffeeScript** - Quickly falling in love with [this language](http://coffeescript.org/ ""). All of the power and awesomeness of JavaScript with none of its miserable syntax.
* **Rails Presenters** - [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself "") has always made sense, but until recently, it also seemed like a hassle and a half (a Hasselhoff?). That is, until I had to change something and realized it was repeated in multiple locations. So, in the never-ending fight against repetitive code, thanks Rails Presenters, for being there.
* **Twitter Bootstrap** - Simultaneously making life awesome, and tech startup websites more generic. My love-blarg relationship with Twitter Bootstrap continues. This week it definitely tilted more toward the love side as I discovered how easy it was to make a site feature tour with [ Bootstrap Tour](http://bootstraptour.com/ "").
* **Metaprogramming** - At first I was all like &#8220;ahhhhhhh" and now I'm all like &#8220;yessss." Definitely risk of hammer-nail syndrome here (explain that in a minute) but I have a side project idea that should prevent me from going overboard and metaprogramming myself so deep into a dream I never wake up.
* **Resque Workers** - Wrote my first one of [these bad boys](https://github.com/resque/resque ""). It broke almost immediately. Then I fixed it, so it's almost like I learned this twice.
* **Counter Cache &amp; Stale Info** - while setting up a counter cache for one of our data models, I learned an important lesson about working with young, web technologies: constant state of flux = never trust a demo that's six years old.

### Hammer-Nail Syndrome
I don't know if I just made this up and I'm really clever or if it's already a thing. Too tired to Google. Basically, it's when you learn something cool and new (for me, SQL and metaprogramming) and you have the impulse to try and use it to solve every problem that comes along. You have a hammer, and everything looks like a nail. Solution: Take a deep breath. Congrats on finding that hammer, now put it away until you actually need it.

### Extra-Curriculars
So this was the first weekend I actually had the energy to start my first side project. So far it's a blast. I'm moving very slowly, taking my time, thinking things through, and letting all of the lessons I learn seep in. I wanted to keep it as relevant to work as possible so I'm doing a Rails project, moving through Michael Hartl's awesome [Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org "") (now updated for Rails 4) and eventually I'll deploy it through Heroku.

Basically, I've learned many metric shit-tons about programming and web development at work, but it hasn't exactly been linear. It's my hope that this side project and the experience of building an entire app from scratch by myself will allow me to fill in any and all gaps that I have.

### A Word About Comfort Zones
I've come to realize that I need to stop lollygagging around in my comfort zone so damn much. Until quite recently (specifically, until I climbed the metaprogramming mountain) I can look back and see a pattern. At first, I'd be in a stable state. I know how to solve the problems at hand, I'm happy. Then I'm handed something I've never encountered. I drag my feet, move out of my comfort zone and start learning and it's really hard and then it starts getting easier and easier until finally that moment of epiphany and I understand it and I'm confident and ecstatic. The only problem is, that becomes the new comfort zone, and the next time an unfamiliar problem comes along, I drag my feet again (hopefully, a little less).

It's time to stop dragging those feet. I recently read this post about [the Beginner's Mind](http://zenhabits.net/how-to-live-life-to-the-max-with-beginners-mind/ "") and that's some good information right there, because it's right. No learning happens inside the comfort zone. It's also boring. I have always felt better finally solving something that had me swearing and sweating than implementing something trivial and easy. Time to do that more often - like, all of the time.
