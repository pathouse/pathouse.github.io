#Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby

I'm almost certain those words were in a song from Guitar Hero III. I would look them up but I know I'd get sucked into some wild internet journey that I'm just not prepared for right now. After getting minimal sleep last night, waking up early this morning, driving down to my grandparent's house in LBI to assist with some post-Sandy cleanup, and then driving back after a full day's work, I decided to get started on my first Ruby project. Don't ask me why. I was struck with a compulsion and now I'm desperately trying to explain myself before this brain of mine calls it quits for the day. It won't be long now...

## Why

I love Ruby. After 3 years of dealing with Java as an undergrad, I thought I had found the cat's secret stash of pajamas when I started fooling around with Python, but Ruby is even better (in this young programmer's opinion at least). You might not agree with me. After all, I'm one of those freaks that actually enjoyed Lisp. 

## What

So, as a firm believer of the mantra "What get's measured gets managed." I've played around with a number of different ways of tracking my progress through given tasks. 

The whiteboard method was ok...
![The Whiteboard Method][1]

But not my favorite, and useless once the number of tasks I needed to track exceeded the space on the board.

Currently, I use the infamous text-file method:

Eagle-eyed viewers will note I took that screenshot while writing this post. Anyway...

## After many long hours...

I have come to the beginning of a solution. It isn't pretty. Currently it doesn't do anything, and it might even been quite backwards.

Here was my thought:

_I want a gui but I don't want to spend the time making a gui, I don't want to download any gui gems or anything like that._

I know, I'm hard to please. Anyway, I figured I'd just take advantage of the fact that I have a browser that can make text files pretty for me and I decided I'd just take my data and make it pretty with HTML and CSS and open it as a local file in my browser. 

## My results

It's far from finished. Currently it's not interactive at all, and I have to wipe and rebuild the main html and css file manually every time I want to update it. But it took me 6 hours and I'm happy, so I put it on [GitHub][3] and I wrote this post and now I'm going to sleep. 
 
Oh yeah, proper attribution and whatnot - I got the CSS for the progress bars from [here][4]
