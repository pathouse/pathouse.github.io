# Dear Sir Ken,

I am one of the 250 million people who have watched your TED talks. I've also read your book _The Element_ and I'm eagerly awaiting your next, due out just a week from today. I don't think it would be an understatement to say that you changed my life. Allow me to explain. 

## A Not So Long Time Ago, in a State a Few Hours Away...

I was a student in college. I was fairly miserable.

## Rewind for a Moment

I don't want to boast but I think it's important that you have some context. I have always been a bright student. I was awarded a 4-year full-tuition scholarship to high school, and yet another 4-year (though not full-tuition) scholarship to college. I never enjoyed school and the occassions when I put forth my full effort in class or on an assignment were rare. 

## Back to College

Things continued on the same way they had for most of my life until my Senior year. For a number of reasons I won't get into right now, I had made a last-minute major change from Computer Science to English. I was absolutely determined to graduate in 4 years, which meant that while my fellow classmates were taking it easy during their final two semesters, I would be hitting the books with a full course load. 

This was the first time I truly applied myself to my schoolwork. It was also the first time I surrounded myself with others who were working just as hard. I did not expect how things turned out. 

## Awake for the First Time

Although it wasn't my best in terms of grades, that semester holds some of my fondest memories from college... All night paper writing sessions, long coffee-fueled discussions about every subject known to man... There was a sense of excitement about learning that I had never felt before, and I've been hooked ever since. 

## Shortly Thereafter...

Upon graduating, rather than feeling the sweet release I had expected, I felt a void. I had spent most of my life trying to avoid learning as much as possible, yet now that it was "over" I only wanted it back. 

It was then that I embarked on my journey of independent learning and came across TED. Your talks were some of the very first that I watched. They opened my eyes and made me realize that it wasn't learning I hated, it was the way we're made to do it in school. 

A year later, I am still at it. What's more, I have made it my life's goal to do whatever I can to change the way that we educate, and the way we think and talk about education. As a programmer, I want to build apps and tools that empower students so that they can rise above the obstacles in their way, regardless of the progress that is made in fixing our broken school system.

## Thank You

For all of these reasons, I am writing to you as part my [Big Shoulders Project][1]. Thank you, on behalf of myself and the countless others whose lives you have dramatically changed.
