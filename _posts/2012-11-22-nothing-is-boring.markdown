Growing up, I never understood how some people spent their lives doing things like measuring the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12 or rolling balls down incline planes to make sure they adhered to Newton’s laws of motion. I thought that at least 90% of what they taught in schools was “boring.”

Now I know better. Nothing is boring. It’s certainly possible to talk about things in boring ways, and there are plenty of boring people out there droning on and on in soul-draining monotones about who-knows-what, but that’s the end of the line. The universe itself is incapable of being boring.

I mean, consider this simple wooden table I’ve just conjured up in your mind. It looks like it’s made of wood, and it is, but we perceive wood as a solid object when, at the atomic level, it’s mostly empty space and force fields. And you thought that table was boring, didn’t you?

No one group of people provide more convincing evidence for my belief that nothing is boring than the speakers at [TED][1]. My discovery of, and subsequent obsession with, TED talks has had a lot to do with my renewed interest in education.

W. B. Yeats once said:

> “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.” 

While there are many ingenious techniques for starting fires, the easiest way is to use something (or in this case, someone) that’s already on fire. So go. Watch TED. Learn something. Set yourself on fire.
