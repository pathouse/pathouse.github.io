## WKNDSTDYBNDR Continues

It appears as though the weekendy study bender has crept into Monday, but that's cause for neither concern nor alarm. Still having fun and that's what matters. 

I'm now of the opinion that [RailsTutorial.org][1] is the best Rails tutorial on the web that I know of. Sorry, [Codeschool][2]. If it's any condolence, you're a close second. 

Anywho, I thought I'd take a quick break to share what little I have encountered on the internet of late that does not have something to do with Ruby or Rails.

### Richard Feynman: 1, Abacus: 0

While I was studying the daylights out of the basic sciences earlier this year, I often came across the late, great Richard Feynman. His interview titled [*The Pleasure of Finding Things Out*][3] is one of my all-time favorites. 

Naturally, I thoroughly enjoyed [this story][4] in which he defeats a man with an abacus, and offers insights on the value of actually understanding math vs. knowing how to use a tool that *does* math.

### Math & Computer Graphics

Speaking of Math, if you've got an hour to kill and you've always wondered about the math that powers computer graphics then [Steven Witten's presentation][5] from [Web Directions Code][6], recently held in Melbourne, is the video you've been looking for.

### Better Explained

[Better Explained][7] is a site I ran across while looking for some reading material about [MVC][8] architecture. While the Ruby material was a bit stale (circa. '07), there is a ton of math content on here that I'm certainly going to take a look at once I get the chance.

### A Bunch of Math Links?

There seems to be some sort of math theme here that I hadn't noticed before. It's really not that surprising, in hindsight. I hated math in school because no one ever told me that it was just another language we can use to describe the world. I thought it was a bunch of hooplah, but now I realize it's awesome. 

### Back to the Grind

And that's enough of that. Back to Ruby on Rails.
