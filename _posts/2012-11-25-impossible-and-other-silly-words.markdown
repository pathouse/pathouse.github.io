## Unafraid to Fail

> "Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools."
> --Napolean Bonaparte

Unless you have a set of step-by-step instructions for life, it’s pretty rare that you’ll know exactly what to do. If you have gotten your hands on some life instructions, they’ve probably been poorly translated from Chinese and I wouldn’t trust their accuracy. It’s safer to assume your next move in whatever it is you’re trying to do is going to rest on the skinny pre-teen shoulders of collected advice, intuition, and past experience.

But why are we concerned with what’s “safer?”

A decision’s “safety” is a measurement of the risk involved. Safe decisions are nice because there’s less risk, which means less fear, which means we have an easier time doing them. So what’s the risk, what is it that we’re afraid of? Failure.

So let’s take a look at this again – we make decisions about things we’re going to do based on whether or not we think we’re going to be able to do them? This seems flawed. Particularly in this cushy civilized world we live in, where the vast majority of our decisions probably won’t involve life-or-death consequences.

Anything worthwhile is rarely easy, but this whole success-driven decision making process seems doomed to forever favor the easiest route and, in doing so, produce nothing worthwhile, ever.

So what’s the key? Conquer and control your fear? Maybe, but I have a problem with that because it’s focused on the negative. I’m not trying to convince myself to do terrifying things. I just want a decision making process that isn’t persuaded by the likelihood of failure.

There it is. Redefine the process. Don’t spend a ton of time trying to wrestle with an emotional response that’s been honed by millions of years of evolution. Just take the emphasis off of the results and place them on the task at hand.

Failure doesn’t exist. What we call “failure” is just learning what not to do. If failure doesn’t exist, you can’t be afraid of it. Your only option is to get excited about all of the wild things you might be able to do if you try. Nothing is “impossible”.

## What was Impossible Yesterday...

Want proof? Just watch [Regina Dugan's TED talk][1] about the incredible work done by the brilliant minds who work for the formidably acronymed [DARPA][2] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). She poses a compelling question that directly relates to what I’m talking about:

> "What would you attempt to do if you knoew you could not fail?"

You can’t fail if there is no such thing as failure. Problem solved.

Throughout history, there have been many men and women who have said things like “no” and “you can’t” and “impossible.” For the most part, we don’t remember these people unless we’re laughing at them while discussing the ones who proved them wrong.
