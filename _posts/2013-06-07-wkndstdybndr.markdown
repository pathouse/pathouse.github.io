# Long Time, No Blog

It's been almost a week since my last blog post. Much has happened. But there's only one thing that matters now... 

This weekend is gonna be an epic study bender. 

## WKNDSTDYBNDR

To prepare, I made a few updates to my Task Tracker project that has been languishing of late. I added some functionality for adding tasks (up until now I've had to manually create the .csv) and made it so that the individual activity entries are not displayed for completed tasks in order to clean up the display until I throw in some JavaScript to make those sections collapsible. 

And now for the __resource list__...

1. [Rails Tutorial][rt]
2. [Rails for Zombies][rfz]
3. [Getting Started with Rails][gswr]
4. [Learning Rails][lr]
5. [RailsGuides][rg]
6. [RailsCasts][rc]
7. [Rails API][rapi]

Now, it looks like a lot, and it is a lot, but this is a study _bender_, remember? Not a study walk-in-the-park. Also, these are _resources_. I'm not going to cover everything in all of these. Right now the plan is to complete at least the first two. However, I always like to gather information from as many diverse sources as possible. No one tutorial I've found is ever perfect, and by having many to choose from I can be reasonably sure that the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts and any area lacking in one will be covered by one or many others.
