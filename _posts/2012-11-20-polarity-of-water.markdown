## H 2 the Izzo

Water (H2O or “H 2 the Izzo” as the kids are surely calling it these days) is a simple molecule in terms of structure and composition. One oxygen atom with two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds. You might think that the molecule required by literally all known forms of life would be a little bit more complex, but there it is.

Despite its apparent simplicity, water has a sizeable bag of tricks up its sleeve, and they're all due to the fact that it's a polar molecule. Here's a quick breakdown of why this is so...

### Polarity in the Shell of a Nut

It's been observed time and time again that atoms will do their best to have exactly 8 electrons in their outer shell – these are called valence electrons and they're the movers and the shakers when chemical reactions occur. When oxygen is all by itself, it has six, which means its very electronegative – it wants to take two electrons from somebody else and fill up its outer shell. Atoms whose outer shells have closer to 8 electrons will always want to take more, while those that are closer to 0 electrons will be more likely to give them away. Hydrogen is a unique case. It only has one electron, so it's not very electronegative at all, but if it loses that electron, it's nothing but a proton, which isn't going to work.

So what happens is this – oxygen and hydrogen “share” that one electron (the textbook definition of a covalent bond), but oxygen's higher electronegativity means that it's far from an equal arrangement. The electron tends to hang out around the oxygen a lot more than it does around the hydrogen, and when you combine that with the structural orientation of the hydrogen atoms, you've got a molecule that's partially positive on one end and partially negative on the other.

To really understand what's meant by partial charge you need to dig into quantum mechanics, but suffice to say that these charges exist more often than the alternative – an even distribution of charge.

## So What?

As it turns out, water isn't so simple after all. These fluctuating charges lead to a host of interesting and useful properties.

When water freezes, the hydrogen bonds that form between the oxygen atom of one water molecule and the hydrogen atom of another (because of those partial charges) keep the molecules further apart than they are in liquid form. This is why ice is less dense than water, which is why it floats and bodies of water don't freeze up from the bottom. Fish and other forms of aquatic life are very happy about this.

And you can thank water for being polar the next time your stirring yourself up a cup of Kool Aid, since water's polarity makes it quite the solvent.

High heat of vaporization, high specific heat, strong surface tension – all because of polarity. Not to mention the fact that the hydrophyllic (“water loving”) and hydrophobic (“water fearing”) properties of other molecules (because of polarity) are the basis of the actions of cellular membranes.

I think you get the idea – water's polarity is what makes water water.

## Science Class is Over

Now, if you're the kind of person that is interested in science purely for the “facts” then you can stop reading right here because that part is over. I have a degree in English so whenever I'm reading something I like to find some deeper meaning in it and that's what I'm going to get into right now.

If you're interested in this kind of thing as well, I encourage you to read Thomas C. Foster's book, [How to Read Literature Like a Professor][2]. I particularly like his thoughts in Chapter 12, “Is That a Symbol” where he says the answer to this question is always “yes,” with one caveat: 

> “Here's the problem with symbols: people expect them to mean something. Not just any something, but one
> something in particular. Exactly. Maximum. You know what? It doesn't work like that.”

The basic idea is that all symbols are subjective in meaning – the author might have had something in mind but we don't know what, and even if we do know what it doesn't really matter because, ultimately, the reader gets to decide for his- or herself. Some people find this idea infuriating, I find it liberating. I can find whatever meaning I want, in whatever I want, and that's pretty awesome. So what I'm going to do right now is look at water as a symbol and see what kind of meaning I can find in it.

### Water Means What I (You) Think it Means

To get started, I want to look at another quote. This one is from a lecture given in MIT's Introduction to Biology course in 2004, which is available through their [OpenCourseware site][3]. Essentially, it says exactly the same thing I've already said about the reasons for the polarity of water, but the phrasing is what's important, particularly if I'm going to analyze it through a sort of literary lens. It's a bit lengthy but bear with me and we'll get through this together:

> “Ideally, there should be no charge on this molecule. And, in fact, there is no net charge. But the
> truth of the matter is, if one wants to get frank, and we always are here, that oxygen molecules have a
> greater affinity for electrons than do hydrogen atoms, i.e. they are electronegative. 
> 
> And, therefore, what this means is that the swarms of electrons that are holding all this together at

> And, as a consequence, there is a fraction of a negative charge here at this end of the molecule and
> there are factions of positive charges here, because it's not as if they've totally given up the
> electrons, but the electrons are shifted more in this direction.”

### Balance Vs. Equality

So, what's going on? Well, there is a balance here, between the charges, but this balance does not imply equality. Let that sit with you for a minute. Now think about all this political rhetoric you hear getting tossed about regarding the inherent “equality” of human beings. Is there real equality (i.e. all the same) or is there balance? It's difficult to come up with the evidence to argue any sort of rigid definition of equality, but balance is evident pretty much everywhere.

What we have here is a classic conflict between what we think things should be like and what they actually are like.

> “Ideally, there should be no charge on this molecule.”

Ideally is the key word here. If the charges were “ideally” balanced and there was no net charge, life as we know it might not exist. I'm kind of glad nature chose to balance differences instead of going for equality. Thanks nature, you're rad.
