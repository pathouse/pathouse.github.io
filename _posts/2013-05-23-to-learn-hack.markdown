## Too Much Reading?

I love reading. I wasn't born this way though. My mom made me read for twenty minutes a day and somewhere along the way I fell in love with books. But that's not point of this post. The point is that for most of my life, loving to read has been very helpful. I doubt I would have done as well as I did in school if I hadn't been such a good reader. But I have also come to realize that there is such a thing as _too much_ reading. 

## Beginning Ruby

I recently purchased Peter Cooper's book [Beginning Ruby][1] and it was the following passage that prompted me to write this post...

> "Learning can be a fun activity in its own right, but merely reading about something won't make you an

And there it was. During my first go-round with programming as an undergrad, this had been one of my biggest obstacles. It wasn't that I didn't experiment - I just didn't experiment enough. I was still in that academic mindset that anything I needed or wanted to know could be found in a book and after I had "learned" it I would be able to sit down and apply it. 

Time after time I was frustrated and now it's obvious why. This time around, I haven't made the same mistake. 

## Learning by Hacking

Much of the reason I've been having so much fun and success in learning Ruby during this past week (and I can't believe it's only been a week since I began) have been the tools I've been using to do so. Tools like [Codecademy][2], [Ruby Koans][3], [Ruby Monk][4], [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][5], and [the book][1] that started all of this, are all focused on actually writing code, working through problems, experimenting, causing errors, and finding solutions. 

And that's the reason I've started my [task tracker][6] project and put it on GitHub. Is it stupid and backwards to write a task tracker whose GUI is nothing more than local HTML and CSS files opened in a browser and can only be controlled from the command line? Almost certainly! But in building it from nothing, I've learned more than I probably would reading a hundred books about the _right way_ to do it.
