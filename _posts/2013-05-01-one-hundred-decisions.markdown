# Seth Godin Does it Again

One of my favorite documents relating to education is Seth Godin's manifesto, [Stop Stealing Dreams][1]. I was recently re-reading it and one section in particular really stuck out at me. 

The following passage is from section 60 - [Dreamers are a problem][2] - and I've put the line that I want to discuss briefly in __bold__...

> Fifty years ago, businesses realized that they were facing two related problems:
> 
> They needed more workers, more well-trained, compliant, and yes, cheap workers willing to follow specific
> instructions…
> 
> and
> 
> They needed more customers. More well-trained, pliable, eager-to-consume customers watching TV regularly and
> waiting to buy what they had to sell.
> 
> Dreamers don’t help with either of these problems. Dreamers aren’t busy applying for jobs at minimum wage,
> they don’t eagerly buy the latest fashions, and they’re a pain in the ass to keep happy.
> 
> The solution sounds like it was invented at some secret meeting at the Skull and Bones, but I don’t think it
> was. __Instead, it was the outcome of a hundred little decisions__, the uncoordinated work of thousands of
> corporations and political lobbyists:
> 
> School is a factory, and the output of that factory is compliant workers who buy a lot of stuff. These
> students are trained to dream small dreams.

## The Small Things

When I talk about education, it's easy for me to slip into the kind of habits of thought Seth warns about here. I'd like to be able to attribute everything wrong to some nameless, malicious entity - some force of pure evil. 

In reality, like Seth points out, it's really just the product of "a hundred little decisions." 

At first, this may seem to be disheartening. We might become gripped by the fear that we are somehow complicit in our own demise. 

Yet, after a moment of panic, the truth becomes clear. This message is one of hope. Sure, a hundred little decisions have produced some poor outcomes that we are all suffering for - but this also means that we don't require some massive force to turn things around. 

All we need are a hundred little decisions of our own, made for the right reasons.
