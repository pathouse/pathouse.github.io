## I Wish I Had This...

If I had been able to watch [Floating University's][1] Great Big Ideas lecture series before I enrolled in college, it might have made things quite a bit easier. Back then, I was paralyzed by a very modern conundrum. I could be _whatever_ I wanted, but I had to pick something by the age of 18, after a primary and secondary education that had barely revealed a third of the possibilities in any sort of depth. 

## Great Big Ideas

[Great Big Ideas][2] is exactly what it sounds like. Twelve professors in twelve different fields give lectures that range from forty minutes to an hour on the "big ideas" in their areas of study. The result is a sweeping overview of potential majors and minors for the vast majority of undergrads that have little or no idea what they would like to do. 

## But I've Already Graduated...

It's true. It's too late for me to go back and reconsider my undergraduate major, even if I actually wanted to. I've already graduated. Yet I still love watching these lectures because learning doesn't end when school does. If anything, I've learned more outside of school than I ever did when I was in it. 

Perhaps the greatest benefit of watching these lectures is that they confirm the notion that Great Big Ideas can be found in every subject. It's true that [nothing is boring][3]. So I encourage you to head over to the site, watch one lecture a day for twelve days, and try and tell me you don't feel smarter for having done so.
