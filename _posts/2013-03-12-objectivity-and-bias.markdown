Hopefully I won’t have to convince you that there’s no such thing as objective journalism. But what about objectivity in general? Does it exist, or is it yet another hipster plot for the sake of irony?

## Objectivity in Science?

Science, it would seem, absolutely depends on the existence of objectivity. Yet, in reality, the Scientific Method is nothing more than a means of coming as close to objectivity as possible – hence the requirement for experiments that can be reproduced by others and the need for peer-reviewed journals.

## Born Human and Subjective

Our human condition dictates that we are bound to our own perspective – a fancy word for the subjective interpretation of events. Is this so terrible? Would the world be a better place if objectivity were truly attainable?

I don’t think so, and I’ll begin arguing the importance of bias with the following passage from Edgar H. Sturtevant’s text, [An Introduction to Linguistic Science][1].

> “I once saw a man, walking along a hotel corridor, meet another man walking in the opposite direction.
> He bent his course a little to the right, but the other man turned left by an equal amount, and they
> would have collided if they had not both stopped short. Then the first man tried to pass on the left,

What we have here is the kind of subjectivity that tries to pass for objectivity in journalism. Just the facts. No opinions. We assume this is somehow more accurate than other possible interpretations, such as the humorous anecdote about a man who almost walked into a mirror, or the lofty discussion of modern detachment from reality, illustrated by the man who couldn’t recognize his own reflection.

## Objective != Accurate

However, lack of opinion does not make this statement any more accurate than the other two. Perhaps the man knew it was a mirror the whole time, perhaps he was practicing some new-age dance moves, or perhaps he suffers from [prosopagnosia][2], also called face blindness, and cannot even recognize his spouse’s face, let alone his own.

Furthermore, this “objective” description of events is incredibly boring and in the end we learn almost nothing. At least the anecdote entertains us and the discussion forces us to consider our tendency to ignore the world around us while we’re lost in our own thoughts.

## We are Subjective Meaning-Constructors

“Objective” experience is almost entirely useless. It’s only by constructing meaning from it – an inherently subjective activity – that we are able to grow and to learn.

There is another reason that bias is a wonderful thing. “Objectivity” would have you believe that one event means one thing – itself, and nothing more. With subjectivity, we are able to discover the endless multitude of possible meanings that might be applied to our experiences. And, because subjectivity is personal, we get to pick the one we like the most, which in my case is an entire blog post’s worth of thoughts.
