"Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you can’t exercise this kind of choice in adult life you will be totally hosed… 

I submit that this is what the real, no bull-shit, value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially, alone, day in and day out… 

If you are automatically sure that you know what reality is and who and what is really important… then you probably won’t consider possibilities that aren’t annoying and miserable. But, if you know how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a hot, crowded, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred – on fire with the same force that lit the stars… 

The only thing that’s capital "t" True is that you decide how you’re going to see it."
