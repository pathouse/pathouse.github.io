## The One World Schoolhouse

Salman Khan’s [The One World Schoolhouse][1] should be required reading for anyone thinking about getting involved in education in any way, shape, or form. I am working very hard right now to fight my temptation to just dump the five pages worth of quotes that I wrote down while reading it. 

In discussing the historical roots of our current system, various reform attempts and ideologies, as well as his own experience building [Khan Academy][2], Mr. Khan blew my mind on a number of occasions. I can’t hold back the quotes entirely, so here’s one to give you a little taste:

> "the crucial task of education is to teach kids how to learn. To lead them to want to learn. To nurture
> curiosity, to encourage wonder, and to instill confidence."

### Key Takeaways

+ Taking responsibility for learning is learning 
+ Dividing things into arbitrary and unrelated subjects is foolish and counterproductive 
+ Mastery learning, mastery learning, mastery learning 
+ Have fun 
+ Don’t be afraid to fail 
+ Creativity is key 
+ Stop treating students like children

and much, much more.
