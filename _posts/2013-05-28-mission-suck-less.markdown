## The Waiting Game

So, last Friday I had my first interview with App Academy and after about 15 minutes of sweaty-palmed coding I had completed the third and final technical round of the admissions process. Now I am waiting to hear back about the next step. 

I don't like waiting. I like being proactive and getting stuff done. So what does a guy like me do when he's finished all of the practice problems, the readings, the homework, and the extra credit? He goes out and finds more challenges. 

One of those challenges, as I mentioned [earlier today][8] is to improve the code for my Task Tracker project. The second is to finish [Ruby Koans][9], which, according to that very same Task Tracker, I am about 89% of the way through. 

The third, is to find ways to constantly work on my problem-solving skills, and after some light Googling, I found my answers. 

## Sucking Less Every Year

Learning to program is a never ending journey. Not convinced? Read Jeff Atwood's post about [sucking less every year][4]. 

So, with that in mind, and with the help of the blog of App Academy alumni [Hugo Melo][1], I have located 5 sites that should supply me with enough programming practice for some time to come. 

## Behold:

1. [Project Euler][2]
2. [Code Kata][3]
3. [Interviewstreet Challenges][5]
4. [HackerRank][6] 
5. [Code Chef][7]
