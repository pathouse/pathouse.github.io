## It Takes Work

Whether or not you buy into the ideas presented in Malcolm Gladwell's [Outliers][] - namely, the infamous 10,000 hours-to-mastery rule - one thing is certain. Excellence takes work. In fact, I'd argue that it takes more than work. It takes _consistent_ work.

Raw talent will only take you so far and with inconsistent practice you'll often find yourself taking a step backwards for every two steps forward. 

## Consistency

Forgive me if this is all terribly obvious to you, but it wasn't to me and so I have to conclude that there are people out there like me for whom it still isn't obvious. Here is how I came to this conclusion that consistency is the key factor; perhaps even more important than both quantity and quality. 

## My Story

I feel as though I've repeated parts of this story over and over again in an effort to explain it to myself and others, so I'd like to take this opportunity to get the whole thing out once and for all now that I'm relatively sure I understand what happened. 

### High School

My first encounter with computer programming was my senior year in high school. The class was an elective, and considered something of a joke by most of my fellow students. It was taught in [True Basic][] and had a very relaxed structure. At the beginning of the semester each student was given a long list of problems to solve by the end of the term, and each day began with a short lecture before we were let loose on our computers to work at our own pace. 

I fell in love with programming. I completed the assigned problems well before the end of the semester and spent the rest of the class experimenting. I thought I hated math until I found myself doing things like using quadratic functions to compute the paths of boulders hurled by catapults. My final project was a Pokemon battle simulator that modified random numbers to compute the damage done by various attacks. 

### College

When I was an undergrad, I was a Computer Science major for the first 3 years. In retrospect, I learned quite a bit, but by my third year I felt confused and discouraged whenever I confronted a new problem. I assumed that I didn't have the requisite talent and I had lost the sense of excitement and limitless opportunity I'd felt in high school, despite the fact that I was using more powerful languages and techniques.

So, feeling defeated, I switched my major to something I knew that I could complete in a year in order to graduate on time - English: Creative Writing - and held on to CS as a minor so I wouldn't feel as though I'd wasted my time. 

### Present Day

After graduating, I started working as a freelance copywriter so I could make my student loan payments while I figured out what I was really going to do for the rest of my life. I had something of a personal renaissance and began devouring all of the educational materials I could find (hence the modest collection of links I've built on my [watch][], [learn][], and [program][] pages). 

As my older blog posts demonstrate, there was a time when I was certain I was going to be a natural scientist of some sort, and after that I was convinced I was going to become a teacher and revolutionize the educational system. However, over and over again, in one way or another, programming kept on coming back into the picture. 

As a copywriter, I found myself writing a Python script to easily insert my copy into the appropriate HTML templates. While studying the sciences I found myself learning the statistical computing language R. Every time I tried to spend just _some_ of my day programming I'd come out of some sort of debugging-blackout at midnight and realize I'd spent the whole day blissfully immersed in some coding project of one kind or another. 

As of today, it's been just over 2 months since I decided to return to programming. It's been only one month since I put my copywriting on hold completely to study it full time. Yet, despite this relatively short time-frame I have not only caught up to where I left off in college, I have surpassed it. I can safely say I've learned more in these past 2 months than in 3 years of undergraduate education. Naturally I had to ask the question - why?

## Consistency 

The answer is not straightforward or simple. I've matured quite a bit, and in many ways I'm not the same person I was when I entered college. I'm more focused, more serious, more driven, etc. etc. But there is one similarity between the way I approach programming now and the way I first approached it in highschool - consistency. 

In high school, I took all of my classes every day, as opposed to college where I took most classes only two or three times a week, and many only once. There are some subjects that can be taught this way. Computer Science is not one of them. The kind of progress I have made over the past two months has me convinced that the value of daily practice cannot be replaced or replicated by other means. 

## Patience

Patience is ultimately a prerequisite for consistency, but it's important enough that I'd like to single it out for a moment. Patience is required because there are days when you cannot move as fast as you did yesterday. This is especially true once you move beyond basic concepts and start encountering the real meat of a given subject. 

I didn't understand this at first and so I despaired, assuming that I had hit some sort of personal wall that I would never get over. I thought I must lack the talent I thought I had when I was quickly moving through the "easy" parts. I was wrong. Some walls just take longer to climb.

## What's the Point

So this has been a long and somewhat rambling post but I'm glad I wrote it. The point I've been trying to get at is this: passion, talent, desire - none of it is enough without old-fashioned dedication and work ethic. 

Perhaps Michelangelo said it best, and I'll let him say it again to close this out.
